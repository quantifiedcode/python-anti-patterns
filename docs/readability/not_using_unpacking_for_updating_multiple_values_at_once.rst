Not using unpacking for updating multiple values at once
========================================================

In general, the Python programming community prefers concise code over verbose code. Using unpacking to update the values of multiple variables simultaneously is more concise than using assignments to update each variable individually. 

Example
-------

The code below updates the values of the two variables ``x`` and ``y`` using assignments that are on separate lines of code.

.. code:: python

    x = 1
    y = 2
    z = 0
    
    a = y + 2  # 4
    b = x - 3  # 1
    c = x + y  # 5

The modified code below is functionally equivalent to the original code above, but this code is more concise. 

.. code:: python

    x = 1
    y = 2
    z = 0

    a, b, c = y + 2, x - 3, x + y  # more concise
